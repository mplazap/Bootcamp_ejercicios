1
00:00:19,311 --> 00:00:22,272
Yo, so, what's next?
2
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:23,774
We wait.
3
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:27,819
We don't got like eight more
anal things we gotta do first?
4
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:30,405
The reaction has begun.
5
00:00:30,614 --> 00:00:33,784
Yeah, I know. So how long?
6
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:38,330
Well, if we had a freezer, the condensed
liquid would cool more quickly...
7
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:41,667
...because, of course,
this is an exothermic reaction...
8
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,877
...which means "giving off heat."
9
00:00:44,086 --> 00:00:46,129
And our desired product is....
10
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:49,508
Put me into a coma, why don't you?
11
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:52,094
What did you just say?
12
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:55,180
What? What? Nothing.
13
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:06,400
No, no, no. Not in here.
14
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,860
Like I'm an idiot.
15
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:12,114
Yeah. Like you're an idiot.
16
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:13,865
Dick.
17
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:27,921
God. Jesus. God.
18
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:29,756
Shut up.
19
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:47,441
Bogdan. Bogdan says I'm not
doing the receipts right.
20
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:49,901
Well, he's got a bug up his butt.
21
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,571
He's got a stick up his butt?
22
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,782
He's got a bug up his butt
about the receipts, anyways.
23
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:59,494
So anyway, he's insisting that I--
24
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:02,956
He's demanding that I stay...
25
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:05,375
...and look over his system...
26
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:08,003
...and I cannot get out of it.
27
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:11,548
Yeah.
28
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,685
-Hello.
-Hi, honey. It's me.
29
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:26,647
-Hey, you. What's going on?
-Nothing much.
30
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:32,611
I was just calling
to say I'm sorry...
31
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,072
...but I'm gonna be late tonight.
32
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,449
Bogdan. He's got a bug up his butt.
33
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:41,703
That's okay. I wasn't planning anything
special for dinner, so....
34
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:46,208
In fact, you could take pity on us
and bring a pizza home.
35
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,585
They're having a two-for-one
at Venezia's.
36
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:51,338
At this point,
I could eat a whole one by myself.
37
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:55,050
Yeah, yeah, sure.
I can pick up a pizza.
38
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,302
Hopefully Bogdan
won't keep me too late.
39
00:02:57,511 --> 00:03:01,765
He better not. Trust me, he does not want
to piss off a hungry pregnant woman.
40
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:07,062
-What's that sound?
-I just sold your favorite piece.
41
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,898
The hideous crying clown.
42
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:13,527
Yeah, and I got 9 bucks
more than I paid for it.
43
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:15,737
Shows what I know about art.
44
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:18,490
Hey, what do you think about Holly?
45
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:21,076
For the baby's name.
46
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:22,828
Do you like it?
47
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,663
I think I really like it.
48
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:28,291
Holly. Yeah, it's nice.
49
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,710
Let me think about it.
50
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:33,171
Just feels right, you know?
It's my new favorite.
51
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,674
Well, it's a front-runner, for sure.
52
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:47,185
Listen, I was thinking, maybe we can
have a little family time this weekend.
53
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,396
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.
54
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,606
You know, just take a drive.
55
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:54,109
The almost four of us.
56
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,528
Maybe we can head up
the Turquoise Trail...
57
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:59,865
...stop at Tinkertown,
maybe grab some lunch in Madrid.
58
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,409
Oh, my God.
We haven't been there in forever.
59
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:03,660
-I know.
-Yeah.
60
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:06,580
So why don't we just do that?
Take a little break?
61
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:09,541
Sold. Sounds fun.
62
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,502
Holly. It's growing on me.
63
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:15,130
Yep. Me too.
64
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:18,925
All right, well, I had better go
and get this in the mail.
65
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:21,803
Why don't you call me
when you're on your way home?
66
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:25,265
-Will do. Love you.
-Love you too.
67
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:09,077
Whoa, simmer down there, sparky.
68
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,335
What the hell did we just walk into?
69
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:19,963
Hey, Uncle Jack,
I don't see Jesse Pinkman.
70
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:22,007
He was right here before.
71
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,467
-Anybody got eyes on Pinkman?
-No.
72
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:28,138
What do you figure? He maybe
headed down that gully there?
73
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:30,140
That's the way I'd go.
74
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:33,268
Frankie, Lester, go find him.
75
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,103
Jack.
76
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:36,605
These guys are DEA.
77
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:47,157
No! Jack, no!
78
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:49,034
Jack! Jack! Jack!
79
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,994
No! No, don't!
80
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:53,371
Jack, don't. No.
81
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:57,208
No, Jack, Jack, Jack! Jack, no!
82
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,545
-Jack, no. Don't kill him.
-Back it up.
83
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,756
-Don't kill him, Jack.
-Get back here.
84
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,257
The hell not? He's DEA.
85
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:06,927
No, he's family.
86
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:09,262
Say again?
87
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:12,057
He's my family.
88
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,225
He's my brother-in-law.
89
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,603
Didn't cross your mind
to maybe tell us...
90
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:19,272
...you had a DEA agent
for a brother-in-law?
91
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:23,693
-Did you know about this?
-I called you off, remember?
92
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:27,364
-I told you not to come.
-Well, it seems to me we did you a solid.
93
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:30,241
-You weren't supposed to be here.
-Too late now.
94
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:34,287
How's about you telling me
what was going down out here?
95
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:38,041
You and your brother-in-law
don't seem to be getting along too well.
96
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:41,169
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't concern you.
97
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:44,547
We just wasted his partner here,
and he's wearing a bullet...
98
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:47,384
...so, yeah, I'd say it does concern me.
99
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,303
This is between him and me.
100
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:53,640
-No cavalry coming?
-No.
101
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:57,268
-You bet your ass the cavalry's coming.
-No, no, no! Jack--
102
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:01,648
Jack! No, the DEA
doesn't know about this.
103
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,150
Not yet.
104
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,239
Hank.
105
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:14,202
Nothing can change
what just happened...
106
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:17,038
...but you can walk out of here alive...
107
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:21,918
...if you just promise us
that you'll let this go.
108
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:26,923
Yeah, I thought as much.
109
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,801
Sorry, man. Just no scenario
where this guy lives.
110
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,970
No, no, no, listen! I have money!
111
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:36,224
I have money!
It's buried out here. It's....
112
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:41,855
It's $80 million.
113
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:49,362
Eighty million.
114
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:57,287
So that's what got
this party started, huh?
115
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:01,041
But this money of yours
won't do me much good in prison.
116
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:04,919
You can go anywhere.
You can do anything. Think about it.
117
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:08,423
You can have any future that you want.
118
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,134
Jack.
119
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,472
Eighty million.
120
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,433
And all you've got to do...
121
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,269
...is let him go.
122
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:23,313
That's a hell of an offer.
123
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,565
What do you think, fed?
124
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,609
Would you take that deal?
125
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,569
It's Hank.
126
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,989
His name is Hank.
127
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:37,160
How about it, Hank?
128
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:39,746
Should I let you go?
129
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:47,796
My name is ASAC Schrader.
130
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,799
And you can go fuck yourself.
131
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:56,805
Hank, listen to me.
132
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:58,848
You gotta tell him.
133
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:01,601
You gotta tell him now
that we can work this out.
134
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,978
Please. Please.
135
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:07,941
What? You want me to beg?
136
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,404
You're the smartest guy I ever met.
137
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,449
And you're too stupid to see...
138
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,870
...he made up his mind
10 minutes ago.
139
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:32,924
Do what you're gonna do.
140
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:11,963
Pretty specific directions.
141
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:15,550
Most people tell me to be somewhere,
they say, "West on the 40...
142
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:19,678
...this or that exit, second gas station
on the left." You know?
143
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:23,349
This here? This is a whole other story.
144
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:27,061
That fancy phone of yours,
where does it say this is exactly?
145
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:33,276
Yeah.
146
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:39,991
Look at this.
They even brought a shovel.
147
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:43,536
Jack, no sign of Pinkman.
148
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:51,002
All right.
149
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,546
Says this is it right here.
150
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:55,298
Dig.
151
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,869
What's that? A barrel?
Couple barrels?
152
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,543
-Jesus.
-Hell, yeah!
153
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:34,671
Oh, Jesus. Would you look at that?
154
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,131
-Hell, yeah!
-Goddamn.
155
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,180
What are you waiting for?
156
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:47,642
Yeah, boss. Hell, yeah.
157
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,687
-Let me get on this side.
-Get that out of there, man.
158
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:39,277
Okay. Pull a barrel off the truck
and load it in the Chrysler.
159
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:42,613
-Seriously?
-Jack.
160
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:46,617
That's like 10 or 11 million right there.
You sure you wanna do that?
161
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:48,494
You gonna make me say it again?
162
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:50,747
Go, go. Chop, chop.
163
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:53,416
Jesus, what's with all the greed here?
164
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,668
It's unattractive.
165
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:00,340
Hey.
166
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,676
Hey.
167
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:06,554
I'm leaving you a barrel.
168
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:09,015
Boys are gonna load it for you.
169
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:12,143
You got the keys to these cuffs?
170
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:25,073
I'm sorry for your loss.
171
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,121
My nephew here, he respects you.
172
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:38,419
He would never forgive me
if things went another way.
173
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,422
Also you caught me in a good mood.
174
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:45,093
So here's what's gonna happen.
You're gonna get in your car...
175
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:48,679
...and you're gonna drive out of here,
all right?
176
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:51,933
No hard feelings.
177
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,018
Understand me?
178
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:57,397
We square?
179
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:02,735
Hey, man, I gotta know we're square,
or we're gonna have to go that other way.
180
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,835
Pinkman.
181
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,714
Pinkman.
182
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:26,759
You still owe me.
183
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,597
If you can find him, we'll kill him.
184
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:35,852
Found him.
185
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:46,612
No!
186
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,824
Get off me!
187
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,075
Get off!
188
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,706
No, no.
189
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:13,890
Good to go?
190
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:20,813
Hey, Uncle Jack.
191
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:32,575
Well, he was out here with those feds.
192
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:37,079
Right? Working with them. Should we
maybe find out what he told them first?
193
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:40,124
Because, I mean, he had
to have told them some stuff...
194
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,710
...that might not be too good for us.
195
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:47,673
And I'll bet we could
get it out of him back home.
196
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,217
I mean, I can do it.
197
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:55,389
Me and him, we got history.
198
00:16:57,767 --> 00:17:00,937
And then, you know,
we'd take care of the job after that.
199
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:05,066
Works for me. Work for you?
200
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,198
-Let's go, pal.
-No.
201
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:13,866
No!
202
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:15,618
No!
203
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:16,994
No!
204
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:18,704
Wait.
205
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:31,759
I watched Jane die.
206
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,310
I was there.
207
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,355
And I watched her die.
208
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:50,403
I watched her overdose
and choke to death.
209
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,448
I could have saved her.
210
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,244
But I didn't.
211
00:22:30,224 --> 00:22:32,977
-Hi.
-Hello.
212
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:36,814
That truck belong to you?
213
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:40,401
It does.
214
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:42,778
I'd like to buy it.
215
00:22:44,405 --> 00:22:46,364
It's not for sale.
216
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:13,684
Hey, Walt, it's me.
217
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:15,561
Just thought I'd try you again.
218
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:18,689
We were just wondering
when you thought you'd be back...
219
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:22,943
...so just give us a call
whenever you can.
220
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:25,154
Bye.
221
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,406
Hey, Aunt Marie.
222
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:30,451
Hey, sweetie.
223
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:34,204
Haven't seen you for a while.
What have you been up to?
224
00:23:34,412 --> 00:23:36,624
Oh, you know. This and that.
225
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:40,418
Your mom and I need to talk,
so thought I'd stop by.
226
00:23:40,628 --> 00:23:43,631
Well, I wish you'd called first.
227
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:46,258
This isn't the best time.
228
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:49,011
Well, Flynn looks like
he can hold down the fort.
229
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:51,263
Why don't we go into your office?
230
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:58,979
I got it.
231
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:02,107
Okay, honey. Thanks.
232
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:19,583
-Marie, I have nothing to say.
-Well, I do.
233
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:22,670
So you can just sit there and listen.
234
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:26,215
I got a call from Hank.
235
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:28,884
He arrested Walt three hours ago.
236
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:30,636
It's over.
237
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:33,639
"Dead to rights"
I believe is the expression.
238
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:37,475
Hank and Steve Gomez are working
with a former associate of Walt's...
239
00:24:37,685 --> 00:24:40,854
...Jesse Pinkman,
whom I know you know...
240
00:24:41,063 --> 00:24:44,525
...and Pinkman has supplied them
with everything they need.
241
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:49,613
Hank is booking Walt as we speak.
242
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:52,408
And I, for one, could not be happier.
243
00:24:58,247 --> 00:25:00,290
I almost didn't come here.
244
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:03,961
Christ, I barely even know
who you are...
245
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:07,631
...and I sure as hell don't know
if I can ever trust you again.
246
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:17,558
And then I think about
how you were so upset with Walt...
247
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:20,561
...and how you wanted
the kids out of the house...
248
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:25,482
...and all of this makes me believe
that there has got to be hope for you...
249
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:29,486
...that whatever he did to you
can be undone.
250
00:25:32,573 --> 00:25:38,037
All I know, all I have been
forcing myself to remember...
251
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:39,788
...is that you are my sister.
252
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:43,417
And so I'm here.
253
00:25:48,297 --> 00:25:49,965
-Marie--
-Everything changes now.
254
00:25:50,174 --> 00:25:53,218
And you have got to prepare yourself.
255
00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:56,554
Hank will help you as much as he can.
I know he will.
256
00:25:56,764 --> 00:26:01,602
And I will support you through this.
257
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,937
But I have conditions.
258
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:07,441
Give me every single copy
of that obscenity...
259
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:10,568
...that the two of you made
to discredit Hank. That DVD.
260
00:26:10,778 --> 00:26:14,114
Every single copy.
261
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:16,574
You understand me?
262
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,161
Answer me. Do you understand me?
263
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:20,788
Yes.
264
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:23,916
Good.
265
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:28,712
Now dry your eyes
and get Flynn in here.
266
00:26:28,879 --> 00:26:32,007
You are going to tell him everything,
and I mean everything.
267
00:26:32,174 --> 00:26:34,551
He deserves to know
the truth from his family.
268
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:38,889
-Not a bunch of uniformed strangers.
-No. No. No, he cannot know.
269
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:42,226
You tell him, or I will.
270
00:26:42,893 --> 00:26:44,853
There's no way around this.
271
00:26:45,062 --> 00:26:48,899
He needs to know,
and he needs to know now.
272
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:23,225
No.
273
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,871
Look, I gave you what you wanted.
274
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:46,331
Come on, please.
275
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:47,875
Hey, please.
276
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:50,544
-I told you where to find the tape, okay?
-Yup.
277
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:53,046
Hey, just go.
278
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:55,757
Just go there.
Just go to his house and get it.
279
00:27:55,966 --> 00:27:58,760
-We're on it.
-Get it!
280
00:27:59,887 --> 00:28:03,432
No one else knows about it.
Just me and his partner.
281
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,602
-Okay.
-No one else knows, I swear!
282
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:01,508
Let's cook.
283
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:14,980
You're completely out of your mind.
284
00:30:16,023 --> 00:30:18,066
-It's the truth.
-It is, Flynn.
285
00:30:18,275 --> 00:30:20,527
Then both of you
are out of your minds.
286
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:23,405
You're full of shit, is what you are.
Both of you.
287
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:27,576
If this is true, then how could you
keep this a secret?
288
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:32,122
I mean, why?
Why would you go along?
289
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:36,668
I'll be asking myself that
for the rest of my life.
290
00:30:36,877 --> 00:30:40,589
So you're saying all this time
you were lying about this?
291
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:44,134
I mean, so you're saying you're a liar.
292
00:30:44,343 --> 00:30:46,303
You just admitted it.
293
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:50,098
So were you lying then,
or are you lying now?
294
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:51,683
Which lie is it?
295
00:30:51,892 --> 00:30:54,561
Flynn, honey, your mother
is telling you the truth.
296
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:57,522
Right here, right now. Believe it.
297
00:30:57,731 --> 00:31:01,693
You know what? This is bullshit.
This is bullshit.
298
00:31:01,902 --> 00:31:03,403
-Baby--
-I wanna talk to Dad.
299
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:06,656
Your dad's in custody.
You can't talk to him for a while.
300
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:09,868
-I'm calling Uncle Hank.
-I've tried. He's not answering.
301
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:12,662
He's probably in the thick of it
with your father.
302
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:15,374
Honey, I know this is a lot
to process, Flynn...
303
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:18,502
...but if you could just breathe,
just try to breathe...
304
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:22,089
-...and just trust--
-Really? Really? Try to breathe?
305
00:31:24,091 --> 00:31:26,134
Oh, my God.
306
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:31,264
Go home.
307
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:34,142
Just take the kids home, okay?
Go home and regroup.
308
00:31:34,351 --> 00:31:36,311
I'll stop by later.
309
00:32:09,219 --> 00:32:10,679
Flynn?
310
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:15,267
Could you put
your seatbelt on, please?
311
00:32:18,687 --> 00:32:21,148
Please. It's not safe.
312
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:24,025
You're shitting me, right?
313
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:32,159
If all this is true
and you knew about it...
314
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:35,662
...then you're as bad as him.
315
00:32:46,173 --> 00:32:48,300
Whose truck is that?
316
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:55,724
Dad?
317
00:32:57,309 --> 00:33:01,771
Listen, I need you to come inside
and pack right now.
318
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:05,025
Mom, Aunt Marie, they said
that you were arrested?
319
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:07,569
-No, just--
-You're some kind of drug dealer?
320
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:09,779
No, just come inside, please. Now.
321
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,114
Come inside. Come on.
322
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:13,158
Go, go, go.
323
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:17,120
-Dad, stop. Just talk to me, please.
-Our priority right now is to pack.
324
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:21,458
-Uncle Hank, they said he arrested you?
-I will discuss all of this later, okay?
325
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:24,127
-Just tell me what--
-Just listen to me!
326
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:27,005
Go into your bedroom now,
grab anything important.
327
00:33:27,214 --> 00:33:30,383
You understand? Go. Now.
Both of you. Go.
328
00:33:30,592 --> 00:33:31,676
Walt.
329
00:33:34,054 --> 00:33:35,138
Why are you here?
330
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,225
Skyler, please,
will you just go get your things?
331
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:40,769
For you and the kids. Now.
This is our priority.
332
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:44,481
Hank had you in custody.
He wouldn't just let you go.
333
00:33:45,315 --> 00:33:46,525
-Where is he?
-I--
334
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:49,611
-Where's Hank?
-I....
335
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:51,571
-I negotiated--
-Negotiated?
336
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:54,908
-Yes.
-What does that mean?
337
00:33:57,035 --> 00:34:00,121
It means we're fine, okay?
338
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:02,999
We are. We're fine.
Everything is gonna be fine...
339
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:05,001
...but we need to leave right now.
340
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:07,504
-All right? Can we do that?
-What happened?
341
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:09,756
Where is Hank?
342
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:11,383
Why do we need to leave?
343
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:15,095
I need both of you to trust me.
344
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:17,264
Right now, okay?
345
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,516
Please, just work with me here...
346
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:23,395
...and I promise I will explain
everything later, okay?
347
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:28,233
Where is Hank?
348
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,446
Skyler.
349
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:43,123
I have $11 million in cash
right outside.
350
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,917
We can have a fresh start.
351
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:49,170
Whole new lives.
352
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:53,383
All we have to do is go.
353
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:55,885
We have to go right now.
354
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:58,513
That's all we have to do.
355
00:35:01,725 --> 00:35:04,686
You killed him.
356
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:10,692
You killed Hank.
357
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,444
-What?
-No, no, no.
358
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:15,196
-You killed him.
-No, no, no!
359
00:35:15,405 --> 00:35:17,115
I tried to save him.
360
00:35:17,324 --> 00:35:19,576
Uncle Hank is dead? I--
361
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:23,246
-Mom, it can't be true. It just can't be true.
-Just stop, please.
362
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:25,415
Everything is gonna be okay.
363
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:29,336
Everything's gonna be fine, I promise,
but we need to leave right now.
364
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:32,005
Dad, what's going on? Talk to me.
365
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:34,591
Just stop for one second.
366
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:37,927
-Look, I told you to get your things.
-Stop walking away.
367
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,472
-There is no time.
-Tell me about Uncle Hank.
368
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,058
-No, just drop it!
-But what's wrong with you?
369
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:47,437
-We're going. We're going right now.
-You have to tell me. Dad, wait.
370
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:51,107
What happened to Uncle Hank?
What--?
371
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:56,571
Get out.
372
00:35:57,697 --> 00:36:00,158
Skyler, I promise you,
we will figure this out.
373
00:36:00,367 --> 00:36:04,079
-Enough.
-Mom, what are you doing?
374
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:06,498
Skyler, put the knife down, please.
375
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:12,379
-I promise you, everything--
-Don't say one more word.
376
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:16,216
Get out of here now.
377
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:18,051
Skyler--
378
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:19,844
Get out!
379
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:28,728
Stop it! Just stop! Just stop!
380
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:32,691
-Let go! Let go!
-Get away from us!
381
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:34,734
Just stop! Stop!
382
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:37,862
Dad, stop it! Stop!
383
00:36:38,071 --> 00:36:39,698
Mom, stop it.
384
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:42,492
Stop, Dad. Stop it now. Stop.
385
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:45,453
Stop! Just, please, stop!
386
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:49,416
Stop it! Stop! Stop it!
387
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:59,592
What the hell is wrong with you?!
We're a family!
388
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,850
We're a family.
389
00:37:10,687 --> 00:37:12,689
What are you doing?
390
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:14,357
What are you doing?
391
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:15,817
Yeah, I need the police.
392
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:18,528
My dad, he pulled a knife on my mom.
393
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:21,281
He attacked her. He's dangerous.
394
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:24,576
I think he might have killed somebody.
395
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:26,453
Yeah.
396
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:29,956
He's still here.
397
00:37:30,165 --> 00:37:33,001
Yeah, he's still in the house.
398
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:36,171
We're at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane.
399
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:39,841
308 Negra Arroyo Lane!
You've gotta come quick.
400
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:44,471
Hurry, hurry. Oh, God, no, no!
401
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:47,223
Oh, my God. No.
402
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:49,642
-Walt, no! Walt!
-Mom!
403
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:51,519
Walt, please, no!
404
00:37:51,728 --> 00:37:54,981
No! No! No!
405
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:57,066
Walt, no! Let her go!
406
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:58,902
You can't take her!
407
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,946
Let her go, please! You can't take her!
408
00:38:02,155 --> 00:38:04,240
Let her go! Walt!
409
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:07,744
Walt, please, no!
410
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:10,288
Walt, no! Walt, please!
411
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:13,249
Walt, no!
412
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:16,252
Walt, please, no!
413
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:19,339
Walt, please!
414
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:22,550
Please, stop! Walt!
415
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,190
Say, "Da-da."
416
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:39,692
Da-da. You say, "Da-da"?
417
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:43,738
There. Get rid of that
stinky old diaper, huh?
418
00:38:43,947 --> 00:38:46,616
Don't be sad.
Where's your belly button?
419
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:49,244
Where's your belly button?
420
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:51,746
There. Now, don't you feel better?
421
00:38:51,955 --> 00:38:54,457
You're all nice and dry.
422
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:57,001
That feels good? Oh, I know.
423
00:38:57,210 --> 00:39:00,672
You were so wet and so cranky,
but now you feel better, don't you?
424
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:05,552
Next order of business
is to get you a brand-new car seat.
425
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,054
Won't that be nice, Holly?
426
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,852
Mama.
427
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,020
Mama.
428
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:18,606
Mama.
429
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:21,901
Mama.
430
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:28,783
Mama.
431
00:39:30,243 --> 00:39:31,995
Mama.
432
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:38,042
Mama.
433
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:50,930
Confirming the abduction.
434
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:53,725
Amber Alert. Holly White.
435
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:56,019
Female, 18 months.
436
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:58,146
Blond hair, blue eyes.
437
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:03,401
Was last seen wearing
a pink and white jacket, pink pants.
438
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:05,194
Abductor is the father....
439
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:10,700
He was in handcuffs.
Hank had him in handcuffs.
440
00:40:11,034 --> 00:40:15,288
Bald head, goatee,
gold, wire-framed glasses.
441
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:19,125
Are you expecting a call?
442
00:40:21,461 --> 00:40:24,797
Hi, you've reached the White family.
Please leave a message.
443
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:27,216
Skyler, it's me. Pick up. Pick up.
444
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:30,803
-That's him. That's my husband.
-I need you to pick up the phone.
445
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:32,430
Start a trace on the landline.
446
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:38,102
-The number's 505-177-8987.
-I know you're there, so pick it up.
447
00:40:38,311 --> 00:40:40,355
Skyler, you hear me?
448
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:43,650
-Need the location of an incoming caller.
-Answer the pho--
449
00:40:47,487 --> 00:40:49,864
Walt, where's Holly?
450
00:40:50,073 --> 00:40:51,658
Are you alone?
451
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:53,618
No police?
452
00:40:55,078 --> 00:40:58,039
No. No police.
453
00:40:58,247 --> 00:41:01,668
Where are you? Where's Holly?
454
00:41:04,087 --> 00:41:07,006
-Walt!
-What the hell is wrong with you?
455
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:11,177
Why can't you do one thing I say?
456
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:13,888
-What?
-This is your fault.
457
00:41:14,097 --> 00:41:16,849
This is what comes of your disrespect.
458
00:41:17,058 --> 00:41:18,768
I told you, Skyler.
459
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:20,561
I warned you for a solid year.
460
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:23,314
You cross me,
there will be consequences.
461
00:41:23,523 --> 00:41:25,566
What part of that
didn't you understand?
462
00:41:25,775 --> 00:41:28,486
You took my child.
463
00:41:28,695 --> 00:41:30,071
Because you need to learn.
464
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:32,156
You bring her back.
465
00:41:32,365 --> 00:41:36,577
Maybe now you'll listen.
Maybe now you'll use your damn head.
466
00:41:36,786 --> 00:41:39,122
You know, you never believed in me.
467
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:42,417
You were never grateful
for anything I did for this family.
468
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:46,337
"Oh, no. Walt. Walt, you have to stop.
469
00:41:46,546 --> 00:41:50,383
You have to stop this.
It's immoral. It's illegal.
470
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:52,802
Someone might get hurt."
471
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:56,723
You're always whining and complaining
about how I make my money...
472
00:41:56,931 --> 00:42:00,852
...just dragging me down,
while I do everything.
473
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:04,522
And now--
474
00:42:04,731 --> 00:42:08,860
Now you tell my son what I do...
475
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:15,783
...after I've told you and told you
to keep your damn mouth shut.
476
00:42:15,992 --> 00:42:19,912
You stupid bitch.
477
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:23,791
How dare you?
478
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:37,555
I'm sorry.
479
00:42:42,769 --> 00:42:46,522
You have no right...
480
00:42:46,731 --> 00:42:50,026
...to discuss anything about what I do.
481
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:52,487
What the hell do you know
about it anyway?
482
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:54,947
Nothing. I built this.
483
00:42:55,156 --> 00:42:57,241
Me. Me alone. Nobody else!
484
00:42:57,450 --> 00:42:59,035
You're right.
485
00:43:01,037 --> 00:43:02,663
You're right.
486
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:06,334
You mark my words, Skyler.
487
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:10,338
Toe the line...
488
00:43:11,214 --> 00:43:14,300
...or you will wind up just like Hank.
489
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:18,429
Walt.
490
00:43:20,223 --> 00:43:22,600
Tell me what happened.
491
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:25,645
Where is Hank?
492
00:43:26,187 --> 00:43:27,939
Please.
493
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:30,358
We need to know.
494
00:43:35,905 --> 00:43:38,491
You're never gonna see Hank again.
495
00:43:43,913 --> 00:43:45,873
He crossed me.
496
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:49,252
You think about that.
497
00:43:51,504 --> 00:43:53,506
Family or no.
498
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:58,302
You let that sink in.
499
00:44:00,555 --> 00:44:02,306
Walt.
500
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:06,561
I just want Holly back.
501
00:44:08,563 --> 00:44:11,149
Please, Walt.
502
00:44:14,152 --> 00:44:16,112
Just come home.
503
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:26,414
I've still got things left to do.
504
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:12,835
Hey.
